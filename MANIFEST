# NOTE

    SNAPSHOTS
    sid		int # > 0 unique key
    when    	datetime
    comment 	string
    ignore	string # \t-separated globs; if empty use ignore from ignore_sid
    ignore_sid	int # if 0 and ignore is empty then there are none

    CAPTURES
    cid		    int # > 0 unique key
    filename	    string # if empty use filename from filename_cid
    filename_cid    int
    content	    blob
    patch	    blob
    content_cid	    int

If content_cid is 0 the content is the current content (which could be
empty if the file is empty) and patch is empty.
If content_cid is > 0 the content is empty and the patch is nonempty:
the content can be recreated by applying the patch to the content from
content_cid.

To do the content/patch/content_cid stuff, create a separate test app
just to do that.
