# NOTE

    SNAPSHOTS
    sid		    int # > 0 unique key
    when    	    datetime
    comment 	    string
    monitored	    string # \n-separated list of filenames being monitored
    monitored_sid   int # if monitored is empty use from monitored_sid's monitored

    CAPTURES
    cid		    int # > 0 unique key
    sid		    int # > 0 the snapshot where this capture was made
    filename	    string # if empty use filename from filename_cid
    filename_cid    int
    content	    blob
    content_cid	    int

- If content is empty and content_cid = 0 then this is an empty file;
- if content is empty and content_cid > 0 then content is in
  content_cid's content_cid, i.e., unchanged (therefore filename
  changed);
- if content is nonempty, then this is the file's data and content_cid
  should be 0.
