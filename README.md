# fhd

The `fhd` “File History Data” package is for use by the GUI
[`FileHistory`](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/filehistory) application
and the command line [`fh`](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/fh) tool. It
provides the underlying functionality that these tools use.

`fhd` keeps all its data in a _single_ file with the `.fhd` extension.
